npm test
```

npm test:coverage
```

## How It Works

1. The `Quiz` class manages quiz state, questions, and scoring
2. The `QuizApp` class handles user interaction through the command line
3. Questions are stored in a separate data file for easy management
4. Tests ensure reliability and correctness of the application

## Adding Questions

To add more questions, edit `data/questions.js` and add objects with this format:

```javascript
{
  question: 'Your question text?',
  options: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3', 'Option 4'],
  correctAnswer: 0  // Index of the correct option (0-3)
}
```
